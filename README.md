Goal/Motivation:

When the user starts opens the intergrated terminal under index.js then enters node index.js, 
they will be given a series of prompts that ask them about their README. These prompts follow 
the guide for a standard README of Github.

Upon completion of the prompts in node, the user will have created their own README based on 
the prompts they followed and data they entered using the node terminal.


Problems Solved:

Once the node terminal is started in the integrated terminal under index.js, the README created 
by the user will then genrate. Then right click and hit open preview. 

The Standouts:

Hoping this just meets all of the criteria for once. I took a long time trying to perfect it. I 
can say I am proud of the result.
    
Challenges Faced:
          
Using and manipulating NODE for the first time. Getting the correct prompts to display in the order 
I wanted them to, how I wanted them to. The badges and getting the correct preview look at the end. 
Which was finally acheived.
